## About

When I pay bills I use a google sheet I created and added macros to sometime in highschool. It's pretty old and hard to modify. This tool is indended to replace that google sheet.

I used [Material UI](https://mui.com/) to quickly make some of the more stylish components.

## Reason

This project is so I can try some new techs. Specifically GraphQL and Ruby on Rails, both of which are new to me. I expect the hardest part of this project will be learning ruby but I am excited to see how it is.

I am also making a large effort to divide the react elements into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.

## How to Use

### Web app

```
rails s --binding=localhost
```

### Tests

// TODO

### Storybook

```
yarn storybook
```

Will run the storybook project on port 6008
